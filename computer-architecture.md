### Hardware and software software tells the cpu what to do

#### How Computers Work:Computers were invented to carry and manipulate information such as how mechanical machines were designed to manipulate physical stuff And it was designed to do 4 things:
3. Take an input
3. Store it
3. Process it
3. Give an output

#### Though we came so far in computer technology it still holds the same basic fucntionality of the previous 4 points.
* The input is what the user orders the computer to do wether it is a voice input or a click or visual input ...etc

* The computer then stores this input as an information inside it's memory

* The computer's processor takes this information and manipulates it using it algorithms (which is a series of commands)

* The computer restores the processed information in the memory and the last 2 steps are repeated till all information is ready to be delivered as an output

* An output varies depending on the type of the computer, it could be visual, audio, text, AR, vr ...etc

* This output could be used as an input to another computer for another process

* Circuts are the components that are responsible for processing those information

* Each circut is a logical process of 0s and 1s, and by combining multiple tiny circuts togother we can process all types of information

* The more complicated the information gets the more powerful computer is needed to be able to store and process such information

* Even the advanced coding languages we use today get converted into 0s and 1s, a simple tag element consists of hunderds and thousands of 0s and 1s

* The CPU is the component that is responsible of doing all these processes

* The OS such as Windows is the master program that decide what other smaller programs can access of the input and output components on the computer
