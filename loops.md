# Operators and Loops

___

## The comparison operators are mainly used to get one boolean value output out of multiple inputs, and there are many operaters each has it's own job.
1. Is equal to: It's used to campare two variables to see if they are the same in value only ==
1. Is not equal to: It's the opposite of is equal to and it's used to see if two variable are not the same value only !=
1. Strict equal to: Similar to is equal to but it checks if the two variables are equal in value and also typing ===
1. Strict not equal to: The exact opposite of strict equal to where it checks if the two variables are not equal in value and also typing !==
1. Greater than: It check if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right >
1. Less than: It's the opposite of greater than where it checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right <
1. Greater than or equal to: similar to greater than but it checks if the number on the left is greater than or equal to the number on the right >=
1. Greater than or equal to: similar to less than but it checks if the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on the right <=
Logical Operators

___

## The logical operators are used to compare the results of more than one comparisn operator, and each one has a different logic to it.

2. Logical and: It's used to test if both of the expressions are true and outputs true, otherwise false &&
2. Logical or: It's used to test if one of the expressions is true and outputs true, only when both are false it returns false ||
2. Logical not:It's used to reverse the state of and expression from true to false and vise-versa !

___

## Loops
 #### Loops are used to check if a condition is true or false, and depending on the return value it runs a certain block of code inside of it several time until the return value becomes false, there are differnet types of loops simialr in functionality different in structure.
#### For loop: It's used to run a certain code for a certain know amount of times if the condition is met, the syntax looks like for (var i = 0; i < 0; i++){document.write(i);}
#### While loop: It's used to run a certaing code for an unkown amount of time depending on the state of the condition, the syntax should look like while (var i < 10){_a certain code_ , _increament_;}, document.write(msg);
#### Do while loop: It's used the same way while is used but it will still execute for one time even if the state of the condition is false.

*loops always check a condition and if its correct the code inside it will execute until the condition be false . types of loops*
